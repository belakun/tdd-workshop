## Triangle kinds
During the exercise we'll consider 3 different types of triangles - Scalene, Right and Equilateral.
Each of such triangles has different formulas to calculate the area.

---
### Scalene Triangle
Every side of scalene triangle should have different length.

Area = √[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)]

Where "s" is a semi-perimeter found as s = (a + b + c)/2

---
### Right Triangle
Right triangle has one corner equal to 90 degrease.

Area = a * b / 2 

---
### Equilateral Triangle
Such triangle has all sides equal.

Area = √3 * (a/2) * (a/2)
